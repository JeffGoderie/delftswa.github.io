The outline should consist of:

A 100 word abstract summarizing your chapter. ~Done
A table of contents for your chapter ~ Partly done
A plan of < 1 page explaining:
- which research on your chapter has finished (deliverables D1-D4 and maybe more) ~Done.
- which research on your chapter still needs to be done (maybe a pull request / contribution, an additional view/perspective, an interview) ~ Partly Done.
- a status per section in your table of contents indicating what still needs to be written / how far you are.
- A first version of your chapter reflecting the current status.

#Outline of final chapter

###Abstract
Play Framework is a Scala/Java based web application framework that focusses on the development of scalable web applications and thus companies that have large and scalable websites like LinkedIn. 
Typesafe is the company that maintains the development of Play. 
Play's development is leaning towards a very strong modular design. 
This improves the maintainability and scalability of the framework. 
This chapter described the developer view and an **xxx** view. 
It also explains the software product line and **xxx** perspectives. 
Finally it provides important metrics that define the assessment of the frameworks Goal and an overview of the future plans of Play.

###Introduction to/Goal of Play Framework
	- Briefly touch upon what Play is
	- Briefly explain how it distinguishes itself from other web dev frameworks (Goals)
	- Ideology of Play/developers? What are key competitive features? Why should Play be chosen instead of other web dev frameworks?
	
###Important stakeholders
_Research from D1 that has been finished._

###Context view & module overview
_Research from D2 that has been finished._

###Standardisation & organisation
_Research from D2 that has been finished. This includes:_

* _Design_
* _Testing_
* _Monitoring_
* _Instrumentation_
* _Code organisation_

###Perspectives
_Research from D2 that has been finished._
_This includes the Software product line perspective._
_Another perspective still has to be researched and written._

	- Here we should have another perspective

###Metrics
_Research from D4 that has been finished._

	- Summary of the outcome of D4. This should characterise Play framework
	- Own experience while investigating in Play?
	
###Future plans/work of Play
	- Maybe this can be our second view that we have to include?
