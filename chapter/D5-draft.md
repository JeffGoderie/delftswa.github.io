#Outline of final chapter

###Abstract
Play Framework is a Scala/Java based web application framework that focusses on the development of scalable web applications and thus companies that have large and scalable websites like LinkedIn. 
Typesafe is the company that maintains the development of Play. 
Play's development is leaning towards a very strong modular design. 
This improves the maintainability and scalability of the framework. 
This chapter described the developer view and an **xxx** view. 
It also explains the software product line and **xxx** perspectives. 
Finally it provides important metrics that define the assessment of the frameworks Goal and an overview of the future plans of Play.

###Introduction to/Goal of Play Framework
	- Briefly touch upon what Play is
	- Briefly explain how it distinguishes itself from other web dev frameworks (Goals)
	- Ideology of Play/developers? What are key competitive features? Why should Play be chosen instead of other web dev frameworks?
	
###Stakeholders
_Research from D1 that has been finished._

The most important stakeholder is Typesafe Inc. Typesafe Inc. is the creator of the Play Framework. Apart from the Play Framework, it [leads development](http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform) of open source projects Scala, Akka, SBT, and others. Typesafe is funded by various venture capitals ([Greylock Partners](http://www.greylock.com), [Shasta Ventures](http://www.shastaventures.com) and [Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/homepage-campaign.page)).

Typesafe is the one and only stakeholder that can be identified with multiple roles of stakeholder classes. It is a *Communicator*, a *Maintainer*, an *Assessor*, as Typesafe ensures that each pull request of Play is conform legal [regulation](http://www.typesafe.com/contribute/cla).

Other important stakeholders are for brevity listed in the table below. For a broader overview, please read [D1](./).

Stakeholder definition:

* _Developers_: construct and deploy the system. They are employees of Typesafe.
* _Users_: of the Play Framework are the type of stakeholder that make use of the system. These are companies that use Play to build their (often client-facing) web services.
* _Supporters_: cloud platforms as a service (PaaS) that support the Play Framework for their users. 
* _Funders_: are stakeholders that fund the development of a system. These are venture capitals that have funded Typesafe Inc..

In the diagrams below, the stakeholders' power with respect to their interest are shown in a [Power/Interest Grid](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_07.htm). Stakeholders in the top right are the most important stakeholders of the system.

###Context view & module overview
_Research from D2 that has been finished._

###Standardisation & organisation
_Research from D2 that has been finished. This includes:_

* _Design_
* _Testing_
* _Monitoring_
* _Instrumentation_
* _Code organisation_

###Perspectives
_Research from D2 that has been finished._
_This includes the Software product line perspective._
_Another perspective still has to be researched and written._

	- Here we should have another perspective

###Metrics
_Research from D4 that has been finished._

	- Summary of the outcome of D4. This should characterise Play framework
	- Own experience while investigating in Play?
	
###Future plans/work of Play
	- Maybe this can be our second view that we have to include?

###Conclusion
