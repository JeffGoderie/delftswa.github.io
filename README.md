# DESOSA

The DESOSA book is Delft's own version of the [AOSA book series](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html).
It stands for DElft Students On Software Architecture.
This book will consist of several chapters each dedicated to a different Open-Source software project where teams discuss, analyse and report on these projects.
