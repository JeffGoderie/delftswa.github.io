<h1>Welcome to the DESOSA book project!</h1>

<p>The DESOSA (DElft Students On Software Architecture) book is the product of the Software Architecture class at the Delft University of Technology. Teams of 4 students each picked an Open-Source project to analyse the code, the documentation, stakeholders and its environment. Over the course the teams produced various deliverables and presentations. At the end of the course we asked them to compile their results into a small 5,000 word chapter to explain their findings to their peers. These chapters can be found in this "virtual" publication.</p>
